You found my user page on GitHub. The interesting stuff is on the individual
project pages, like [Live Coding in Python]. You can contact me
[@donkirkby][twitter], or use [e-mail] if you're old school.

If you're wondering whether I can write anything besides code, check out my
Stack Overflow profile:

It seems very odd to me that a web site I mostly use to keep notes whenever I
research a tricky programming problem says that those notes have helped several
million strangers.

## Projects
Here's a list of some projects I've worked on. Let me know if you find any
of them useful or fun. If you'd like to collaborate with me in your spare time,
talk to me about one of these, or check out some of my other [ideas].

### Board Games and Puzzles
* [Donimoes] - New games and puzzles I designed, along with games by other
    designers.
* [Vograbulary] - A collection of word games that might help you grab a few 
    new words for your vocabulary. Still in early releases with only a few 
    games: Ultraghost, Russian Dolls, and Bacronyms. 
* [The Infinite Board Game] - A book of games for the piecepack, including 
    two I designed, one with Jay Cormier. The book comes with a piecepack 
    (tiles, coins, pawns, and dice) and the rules for 50 games. If you already 
    have a piecepack, the rules for my games are on the [piecepack wiki]. 
* [Abstract Games Magazine] - I helped out with proofreading and game 
    reviews back in the early 2000s, and I'm happy to announce that it has 
    returned in 2019! You can now read all the articles on the web site, or buy 
    a paper edition. 
* [Game and Puzzle Design Journal] - I was on the editorial panel for this 
    academic journal with articles like an analysis of influence between 
    countries in Risk or a description of the Japanese concept of poka-yoke for 
    using design elements to embed the rules of a game in the game components. 
    The journal is now on hiatus, but you can still buy the old issues, or you 
    can read a few [free articles] posted on the web site.
* [Blind Hex] - I designed this board game to try and make simultaneous 
    movement as elegant as possible. I also used it to test out my Live Coding 
    in Python tool when I wrote the code to draw the game board. 
* [Fortune Puzzles] - Based on an idea from a book of party games, I used 
    the sayings from the Unix fortune command to generate puzzles that you can 
    solve as a group. 
* [The Time Traveller's Tow Truck] - A time-travelling trivia game that I 
    designed as a way to let the players create their own historical trivia 
    questions.

### Software
* [Live Coding in Python] - Lets you play with Python code, and continuously
    runs the code while you edit it. You can use it to create interesting 
    graphics, or see what's happening inside your code. Now includes a 
    debugging tool: Space Tracer. 
* [Testing Python] - An essay on unit testing in Python, along with some 
    sample code. 
* [Kive] - Tracks changes to data processing scripts and links each result 
    back to the source data and script versions that produced it. This is one of
    the projects I get paid to work on at the
    [BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS]. We use it to track our
    bioinformatics pipelines that analyze genetic sequence data from HIV and
    Hepatitis C infections. 
* [MiCall] - Maps hundreds of thousands of small genetic sequences to a set 
    of reference sequences, then stitches them all together. Useful for finding 
    out which drugs will be effective for a patient's HIV or Hepatitis C 
    infection, as well as examining the virus's evolution in a patient or in a 
    community. This is another of the projects I get paid to work on at the
    [BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS]. 
* [Ticking Test] - This library ports the [MultithreadedTC] library from 
    Java to .NET. You can download the source code from the
    [Ticking Test repository], and you will find an example multi-threaded 
    class with some test cases. The library lets you declare a method for 
    each thread that you want to run, and then coordinate the timing of the 
    thread execution with checkpoints called ticks. 
* [Simple Chinese Writer] - Helps you write Chinese text in your browser, 
    using basic vocabulary. It highlights uncommon words that Chinese learners 
    might not know, and also displays pinyin pronunciation with the characters. 
    It's a Chinese version of XKCD's [Simple Writer]. 
* [Chinese Vocabulary Flashcards] - A fun project to generate several 
    thousand flashcards for reviewing Chinese characters. I combined several 
    sources of data on character frequency and definitions. The most interesting
    part was converting the data from a stroke order animation tool to static 
    images. It makes the stroke orders easier to follow in the same way that 
    static visualizations of [sorting algorithms] are easier to follow than 
    [animated sorting algorithms]. 
* [Chinese Reading Practice] - After I'd learned enough characters, I wanted
    to practice reading, but it was frustrating to always have to look up 
    unknown characters. I filtered through the Chinese sentences on
    [tatoeba.org] to find sentences that only used the most common characters.

### Other Stuff
* [Birthday cakes for programmers] - A birthday cake that I designed for a coworker. It's decorated with C
        code that prints the words to "Happy Birthday". Also includes a bunch of
        cakes by other people.
* [Top 40 Years Ago] - Top 40 music history from 40 years ago in a twitter feed.
