Here's a list of some projects I've worked on. Let me know if you find any
of them useful or fun.
<dl>
    <dt><a href="live-py-plugin">Live Coding in Python</a></dt>
        <dd>Lets you play with Python code, and
        continuously runs the code while you edit it. You can use it to create
        interesting graphics, or see what's happening inside your code.</dd>
    <dt><a href="vograbulary">Vograbulary</a></dt>
        <dd>A collection of word games that might help you grab a few new
        words for your vocabulary. Still in early releases with only a few
        games: Ultraghost, Russian Dolls, and Bacronyms.</dd>
    <dt>[Testing Python][testing]</dt>
        <dd>An essay on unit testing in Python, along with some sample code.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.workman.com/products/9780761185154/">The
        Infinite Board Game</a></dt>
        <dd>A book of games for the piecepack, including two I designed,
        one with Jay Cormier. The book comes with a piecepack (tiles,
        coins, pawns,
        and dice) and the rules for 50 games. You can order your own copy
        from the link above or from
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761185151>amazon.com</a>.
        If you already have a piecepack, the rules for my games are
        on <a href="http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/DonKirkby">the piecepack
        wiki</a>.</dd>
    <dt><a href="donimoes">Donimoes</a></dt>
        <dd>A domino puzzle I designed, inspired by Rush Hour and Mahjong
        matching puzzles.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://gapdjournal.com/">Game and Puzzle Design
    Journal</a></dt>
        <dd>I'm on the editorial panel for this academic journal with
        articles like an analysis of influence between countries in Risk
        or a description of the Japanese concept of poka-yoke for using
        design elements to embed the rules of a game in the game
        components. You can subscribe to two issues per year, or you can
        read a few <a href="http://gapdjournal.com/issues/">free
        articles</a> posted on the web site.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://cfe-lab.github.io/Kive/">Kive</a></dt>
        <dd>Tracks changes to data processing scripts and links each result
        back to the source data and script versions that produced it. This
        is one of the projects I get paid to work on at the
        <a href="http://www.cfenet.ubc.ca/">BC Centre for Excellence in
        HIV/AIDS</a>. We use it to track our bioinformatics pipelines that
        analyze genetic sequence data from HIV and Hepatitis C infections.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall">MiCall</a></dt>
        <dd>Maps hundreds of thousands of small genetic sequences to a
        set of reference sequences, then stitches them all together. Useful
        for finding out which drugs will be effective for a patient's HIV
        or Hepatitis C infection, as well as examining the virus's
        evolution in a patient or in a community. This is another of the
        projects I get paid to work on at the
        <a href="http://www.cfenet.ubc.ca/">BC Centre for Excellence in
        HIV/AIDS</a>.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/TickingTest">Ticking Test</a></dt>
        <dd>This library ports the 
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/">MultithreadedTC</a> 
        library from Java to .NET. You can download the Ticking Test source code 
        from <a href="https://github.com/donkirkby/donkirkby/tree/master/TickingTest">the 
        repository</a>, and you will find an example multi-threaded class with some 
        test cases.</dd>
        <dd>The library lets you declare a method for each thread that you want to 
        run, and then coordinate the timing of the thread execution with checkpoints 
        called ticks.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/ChineseVocabulary">Chinese
    Vocabulary Flashcards</a></dt>
        <dd>A fun project to generate several thousand flashcards for reviewing
        Chinese characters. I combined several sources of data on character 
        frequency and definitions. The most interesting part was converting the 
        data from a stroke order animation tool to static images. It makes the 
        stroke orders easier to follow in the same way that 
        <a href="http://sortvis.org/">static visualizations of sorting 
        algorithms</a> are easier to follow than 
        <a href="http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/">animated sorting 
        algorithms</a>.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/sentences.html">Chinese
    Reading Practice</a></dt>
        <dd>After I'd learned enough characters, I wanted to practice reading, but
        it was frustrating to always have to look up unknown characters. I filtered
        through the Chinese sentences on 
        <a href="http://tatoeba.org">tatoeba.org</a> to find sentences that only
        used the most common characters.</dd>
    <dt><a href="blind-hex">Blind Hex</a></dt>
        <dd>I designed this board game to try and make simultaneous movement as
        elegant as possible. I also used it to test out my Live Coding in Python
        tool when I wrote the code to draw the game board.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/FortunePuzzles">Fortune
    Puzzles</a></dt>
        <dd>Based on an idea from a book of party games, I used the sayings from
        the Unix fortune command to generate puzzles that you can solve as a 
        group.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/TimeTravellersTowTruck">The
    Time Traveller's Tow Truck</a></dt>
        <dd>A time-travelling trivia game that I designed as a way to let the 
        players create their own historical trivia questions.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.blogspot.ca/2011/05/birthday-cakes-for-programmers.html">Birthday
    cakes for programmers</a></dt>
        <dd>A birthday cake that I designed for a coworker. It's decorated with C
        code that prints the words to "Happy Birthday". Also includes a bunch of
        cakes by other people.</dd>
