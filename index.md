Here's a list of some projects I've worked on. Let me know if you find any
of them useful or fun.
<dl>
    <dt><a href="live-py-plugin">Live Coding in Python</a></dt>
    <dd>Lets you play with Python code, and
    continuously runs the code while you edit it. You can use it to create
    interesting graphics, or see what's happening inside your code.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="vograbulary">Vograbulary</a></dt>
    <dd>A collection of word games that might help you grab a few new
    words for your vocabulary. Still in early releases with only a few
    games: Ultraghost, Russian Dolls, and Bacronyms.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://www.workman.com/products/9780761185154/">The
    Infinite Board Game</a></dt>
    <dd>A book of games for the piecepack, including one that I
    designed with Jay Cormier. The book comes with a piecepack (tiles,
    coins, pawns,
    and dice) and the rules for 50 games. You can order your own copy
    from the link above or send a few cents my way by ordering from
    <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0761185151/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=0761185151&linkCode=as2&tag=donkir00-20">amazon.ca</a>
    or
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761185151/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0761185151&linkCode=as2&tag=donkir-20&linkId=T5EXILXS6BEVRT5O">amazon.com</a>.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://gapdjournal.com/">Game and Puzzle Design
    Journal</a></dt>
    <dd>I'm on the editorial panel for this academic journal with
    articles like an analysis of influence between countries in Risk
    or a description of the Japanese concept of poka-yoke for using
    design elements to embed the rules of a game in the game
    components. You can subscribe to two issues per year, or you can
    read a few <a href="http://gapdjournal.com/issues/">free
    articles</a> posted on the web site.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://cfe-lab.github.io/Kive/">Kive</a></dt>
    <dd>Tracks changes to data processing scripts and links each result
    back to the source data and script versions that produced it. This
    is one of the projects I get paid to work on at the
    <a href="http://www.cfenet.ubc.ca/">BC Centre for Excellence in
    HIV/AIDS</a>. We use it to track our bioinformatics pipelines that
    analyze genetic sequence data from HIV and Hepatitis C infections.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="https://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/TickingTest">Ticking Test</a></dt>
    <dd>This library ports the 
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/">MultithreadedTC</a> 
    library from Java to .NET. You can download the Ticking Test source code 
    from <a href="https://github.com/donkirkby/donkirkby/tree/master/TickingTest">the 
    repository</a>, and you will find an example multi-threaded class with some 
    test cases.</dd>
    <dd>The library lets you declare a method for each thread that you want to 
    run, and then coordinate the timing of the thread execution with checkpoints 
    called ticks.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/ChineseVocabulary">Chinese
    Vocabulary Flashcards</a></dt>
    <dd>A fun project to generate several thousand flashcards for reviewing
    Chinese characters. I combined several sources of data on character 
    frequency and definitions. The most interesting part was converting the 
    data from a stroke order animation tool to static images. It makes the 
    stroke orders easier to follow in the same way that 
    <a href="http://sortvis.org/">static visualizations of sorting 
    algorithms</a> are easier to follow than 
    <a href="http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/">animated sorting 
    algorithms</a>.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/sentences.html">Chinese
    Reading Practice</a></dt>
    <dd>After I'd learned enough characters, I wanted to practice reading, but
    it was frustrating to always have to look up unknown characters. I filtered
    through the Chinese sentences on 
    <a href="http://tatoeba.org">tatoeba.org</a> to find sentences that only
    used the most common characters.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="blind-hex">Blind Hex</a></dt>
    <dd>I designed this board game to try and make simultaneous movement as
    elegant as possible. I also used it to test out my Live Coding in Python
    tool when I wrote the code to draw the game board.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="https://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/FortunePuzzles">Fortune
    Puzzles</a></dt>
    <dd>Based on an idea from a book of party games, I used the sayings from
    the Unix fortune command to generate puzzles that you can solve as a 
    group.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.github.com/donkirkby/TimeTravellersTowTruck">The
    Time Traveller's Tow Truck</a></dt>
    <dd>A time-travelling trivia game that I designed as a way to let the 
    players create their own historical trivia questions.</dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://donkirkby.blogspot.ca/2011/05/birthday-cakes-for-programmers.html">Birthday
    cakes for programmers</a></dt>
    <dd>A birthday cake that I designed for a coworker. It's decorated with C
    code that prints the words to "Happy Birthday". Also includes a bunch of
    cakes by other people.</dd>
