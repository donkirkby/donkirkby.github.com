title: Project Ideas
subtitle: What should we build tonight, Brain?
---
Interested in working with me on a project? Here are some ideas for
new projects that I've been thinking of starting:

* **Rotten tomatoes mashup with Bibliocommons** - Sort movies and TV shows from
    the [library][] based on their [Rotten Tomatoes][] score.
* **Cosmic Ray** - This is someone else's project, but I've been meaning to try
    it out, and maybe contribute a mutator or something.
* **Chinese poems to read** - Crawl the examples at [chinese-poems.com][] and
    look for ones that use vocabulary I know.
* **HyperDev Twitterbot** - Try out [HyperDev][] with a toy project like a
    twitterbot. Looks at following relationships to find two influential tweeters
    where A follows B directly, but B follows A through n hops. Make a
    competition of it, and announce each day/week's winner.
* **Geysers** - Explorable explanation of how geysers work. @ncasemare mentioned
    some libraries that help build explorable explanations.
* **BitTorrent visualization** - Explain how the BitTorrent protocol works.
    Straight SVG using same tools as Chinese stroke order project? Maybe
    Processing.js? Straight HTML5 canvas? Live coding? Similar to [sortvis.org][]
* **Board game tutor** - Start with simpler games like 3D tic tac toe, generate
    problems to solve, and coach moves during play. Maybe use the tools at
    [ggp.org][], [palamedes-ide][] (dead?), or [cadia player][] (C++). Check
    out some [basic examples][] to start with. Is [axiom][] an open-source
    version of Zillions? There are simple Monte Carlo Tree Search examples at
    [mcts.ai][]. Collaborate on Tavener and Browne's [AiAi][].
* **nand2tetris** - an amazing course that takes you up the architecture stack
    from simple logic gates, "nand gates", through chip design, to the operating
    system, to an application, "Tetris". I've completed the first half on
    [Coursera][]. It's also available from [nand2tetris.org][]. 
* **Box2d demo** - Follow the model of the [Learn Git Branching][] tutorial,
    and live coding.
* **Text diagrams** - Extend ditaa.sourceforge.net with the kinds of features in
    UMLet.com, websequencediagrams.com, and yuml.me. Let the user embed UML
    diagrams in a wiki page and easily edit them.
    Also look at http://www.zanthan.com/itymbi/archives/cat_sequence.html and
    sdedit.sourceforge.net. Maybe even Umbrello.
    Maybe do game diagrams or piecepack diagrams instead to help publish game
    rules? 
    Add attributes: title, caption, and script. Script contains code to draw
    more diagram.
* **Timer / Scorekeeper app** - Different game timer styles, scorekeeper like
    Cribbage board, view score history and adjust, lose abilities as you run
    out of time, lose game when clock reaches zero. Handicapping features?
* **Logic Puzzles** - Android app to publish puzzles from mathgrant.blogspot.ca
    and gmpuzzles.com, maybe add computer generated ones and a way to share your
    own.
