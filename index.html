<p>Here's a list of some projects I've worked on. Let me know if you find any
of them useful or fun.</p>
<dl>
	<dt><a href="live-py-plugin">Live Coding in Python</a></dt>
	<dd>This is my current passion. It lets you play with Python code, and
	continuously runs the code while you edit it. You can use it to create
	interesting graphics, or see what's happening inside your code.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="http://code.google.com/p/donkirkby/wiki/ChineseVocabulary">Chinese
	Vocabulary Flashcards</a></dt>
	<dd>A fun project to generate several thousand flashcards for reviewing
	Chinese characters. I combined several sources of data on character 
	frequency and definitions. The most interesting part was converting the 
	data from a stroke order animation tool to static images. It makes the 
	stroke orders easier to follow in the same way that 
	<a href="http://sortvis.org/">static visualizations of sorting 
	algorithms</a> are easier to follow than 
	<a href="http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/">animated sorting 
	algorithms</a>.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="http://donkirkby.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/frequency-flashcards/sentence-rank/output/sentences.html">Chinese
	Reading Practice</a></dt>
	<dd>After I'd learned enough characters, I wanted to practice reading, but
	it was frustrating to always have to look up unknown characters. I filtered
	through the Chinese sentences on 
	<a href="http://tatoeba.org">tatoeba.org</a> to find sentences that only
	used the most common characters.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="blind-hex">Blind Hex</a></dt>
	<dd>I designed this board game to try and make simultaneous movement as
	elegant as possible. I also used it to test out my Live Coding in Python
	tool when I wrote the code to draw the game board.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="https://code.google.com/p/donkirkby/wiki/FortunePuzzles">Fortune
	Puzzles</a></dt>
	<dd>Based on an idea from a book of party games, I used the sayings from
	the Unix fortune command to generate puzzles that you can solve as a 
	group.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="http://code.google.com/p/donkirkby/wiki/TimeTravellersTowTruck">The
	Time Traveller's Tow Truck</a></dt>
	<dd>A time-travelling trivia game that I designed as a way to let the 
	players create their own historical trivia questions.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="http://donkirkby.blogspot.ca/2011/05/birthday-cakes-for-programmers.html">Birthday
	cakes for programmers</a></dt>
	<dd>A birthday cake that I designed for a coworker. It's decorated with C
	code that prints the words to "Happy Birthday". Also includes a bunch of
	cakes by other people.</dd>
